# Monocle IP Camera Arduino Library
This library works in conjunction with the MonocleCam cloud service to provide camera control and automation for ONVIF supported network/IP cameras.

PTZ (Pan, Tilt, Zoom) control, recalling presets and setting camera's home position are supported via a locally running Monocle Gateway service.  The Monocle Gateway service can communicate with the MonocleCam cloud services to obtain a listing of your configured cameras and subscribe to the current camera actively viewed by the Monocle Alexa Smart Home skill.
